`Midarr` has arrived and aims to provide a media experience like none other:

* Beautifully crafted interface to enhance your viewing experience
* Social from the get go - user online and watch statuses
* User invitations to share the experience
* Integrations with Radarr and Sonarr

with plenty more to come...

![Preview](docs/home.png)

#### What is this?

`Midarr` in its' current preview form, is a lightweight (albeit companion) media server to the likes of Radarr and Sonarr. It relies on the integration with these services to serve your **MP4** format media untouched and unscathed.

While more fully fledged media server options already exist, `Midarr` simply compliments as a lightweight alternative.

#### What does it not do?

`Midarr` currently does not:
* Index your media
* Transcode your media
* Edit or configure your media

#### What does it do?

Your media is retrieved and served through a familiar web interface and provides:
* User authentication
* User profile settings
* User online statuses

with more features planned ahead.

## Usage

Docker compose example:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

volumes:
  database-data:

services:
  midarr:
    image: ghcr.io/midarrlabs/midarr-server:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    volumes:
      - /path/to/movies:/radarr/movies/path
      - /path/to/shows:/sonarr/shows/path
    environment:
      - DB_USERNAME=my_user
      - DB_PASSWORD=my_password
      - DB_DATABASE=my_database
      - DB_HOSTNAME=postgresql
      - SETUP_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@email.com
      - SETUP_ADMIN_NAME=admin
      - SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=passwordpassword # min length 12
    depends_on:
      postgresql:
        condition: service_healthy

  postgresql:
    image: postgres
    volumes:
      - database-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=my_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_password
      - POSTGRES_DB=my_database
    healthcheck:
      test: "exit 0"
```

## Configuration

#### Volumes

Volumes must be provided as mounted in your Radarr and Sonarr instances:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/movies:/radarr/movies/path
  - /path/to/shows:/sonarr/shows/path
```
This is so `Midarr` has the same reference to your media library as your integrations, and can serve them.

#### Setup

An admin account will be initialised for you on server startup, provided you have these `environment` variables configured:

```yaml
environment:
  - SETUP_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@email.com
  - SETUP_ADMIN_NAME=admin
  - SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=passwordpassword # min length 12
```
Login with these credentials, and access the `Settings` page to configure your server.

## Video support

* Video H.264
