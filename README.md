`Midarr` has arrived and aims to provide a media experience like none other:

* Beautifully crafted interface to enhance your viewing experience
* Social from the get go - user online and watch statuses
* User invitations to share the experience
* Integrations with Radarr and Sonarr

with plenty more to come...

#### What is this?

`Midarr` in its' current preview form, is a lightweight (albeit companion) media server to the likes of Radarr and Sonarr. It relies on the integration with these services to serve your **MP4** format media untouched and unscathed.

While more fully fledged media server options already exist, `Midarr` simply compliments as a lightweight alternative.

#### What does it not do?

`Midarr` currently does not:
* Index your media
* Transcode your media
* Edit or configure your media

#### What does it do?

Your media is retrieved and served through a familiar web interface and provides:
* User authentication
* User profile settings
* User online statuses

with more features planned ahead.

## Usage

Docker compose example:

```yaml
version: '3'

volumes:
  database-data:

services:
  midarr:
    image: ghcr.io/midarrlabs/midarr-server:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    volumes:
      - /path/to/radarr/movies:/any/path #i.e. /movies
      - /path/to/sonarr/shows:/any/path #i.e. /shows
    environment:
      - DB_USERNAME=my_user
      - DB_PASSWORD=my_password
      - DB_DATABASE=my_database
      - DB_HOSTNAME=postgresql
      - SETUP_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@email.com
      - SETUP_ADMIN_NAME=admin
      - SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=passwordpassword
    depends_on:
      - postgresql

  postgresql:
    image: bitnami/postgresql:14
    volumes:
      - database-data:/bitnami/postgresql
    environment:
      - POSTGRESQL_USERNAME=my_user
      - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=my_password
      - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=my_database
```

## Configuration

Volumes must be provided as mounted in your Radarr and Sonarr instances:
```bash
/path/to/radarr/movies:/any/path #i.e. /movies
/path/to/sonarr/shows:/any/path #i.e. /shows
```
This is so `Midarr` has the same reference to your media library as your integrations, and can serve them.

## Gotchas

#### Media codec support
* Video H.264
* Audio AAC / MP3
* Container MP4

#### Server setup

An admin account will be initialised for you on server startup, provided you have these `environment` variables configured:
```yaml
    environment:
      - SETUP_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@email.com
      - SETUP_ADMIN_NAME=admin
      - SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=passwordpassword
```
Login with these credentials, and access the `Settings` page to configure your server.
